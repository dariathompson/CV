I am a junior full-stack developer with a passion for problem solving and an eagerness to learn. As a kid I was obsessed with puzzles, so when I completed a Front End Development course at [Beetroot Academy](https://beetroot.academy/en/), it was only natural my love for coding began to grow. The creativity and logic required to solve complex problems, the endless learning and being able to see your ideas come to life, it is everything that I am passionate about. It has allowed me to co-create one of my projects [Puppy Pals](https://github.com/dariathompson/puppy-pals), an app that helps owners match dogs for socialization, training and play dates. I am now ready to join a team where I can continue my learning and utilise my programming skills and experience of working in logistics to help contribute in solving real world problems.

## Skills

**Adaptability**\
After moving countries twice and changing schools three times, being adaptable became second nature to me. This trait was enhanced further during Makers Academy, when the course became remote. Whether adapting to new ways of working in an ever-changing world, or adjusting to user requirements, I am extremely capable.

**Teamwork**\
Working well with others is one of the most important skills in any job. I believe that learning from other people is the fastest way to build your own understanding. I've demonstrated and developed these skills during my previous career in Sales and continue to apply them in group agile projects at Makers, such as Acebook, Makersbnb and Space Trash. After graduating Makers I continued to collaborate with other people to do projects and learn together.

**Problem solving**\
In my previous career as a Sales Assistant for a construction company we had an issue where we were not meeting targets and needed to come up with a viable solution. I suggested we should host quarterly events where we invite developers to collaborate and discuss the latest trends and technology within the construction industry. This would give us the opportunity to present our products and services, network and further develop relationships with existing or potential clients. As a result sales increased by 20% next quarter.

**Communication**\
While studying at university I also tutored Russian to an American student in my spare time. In just over a month of hard work we made huge progress and he could speak more fluent Russian and had a greater understanding of the language.

Speak English, Russian and Ukrainian

## Experience

**Belyi Irbis (January 2016 to January 2019)**\
Sales Administrator
* Made product presentations in front of panels of clients.
* Negotiated pricing, quantity and lead-time delivery terms and key product inputs from factories and suppliers.
* Assisted customers with product evaluation and used my knowledge of product lines to advise best alternatives.

## Hobbies

* Yoga. The best way to relax and stretch after day of coding. Enjoy doing yoga inside or outside, just need my yoga mat and I can disconnect and refocus.
* Horse riding. I grew up surrounded by animals and for me time that you spend with a horse is similar to meditation. You live in the moment and concetrate only on the movement.
* Reading. I can read any time, anywhere. Just give me an exciting book and I will dissapear for hours.
