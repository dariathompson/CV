I am a junior full-stack developer with a passion for problem solving and an eagerness to learn. As a kid I was obsessed with puzzles, so when I completed a Front End Development course at [Beetroot Academy](https://beetroot.academy/en/), it was only natural my love for coding began to grow. The creativity and logic required to solve complex problems, the endless learning and being able to see your ideas come to life, it is everything that I am passionate about. It has allowed me to co-create one of my projects [Puppy Pals](https://github.com/dariathompson/puppy-pals), an app that helps owners match dogs for socialization, training and play dates. I am now ready to join a team where I can continue my learning and utilise my programming skills and experience of working in logistics to help contribute in solving real world problems.

## Skills

**Problem solving**\
In my previous career as a Sales Assistant for a construction company, it was important to have a problem-solving mindset as problems that could arise were sometimes unpredictable and complex. I would always tackle issues with a positive, can-do attitude, and we as a team would often think of effective solutions to ensure the clients' needs were met. We had an issue where we were not meeting targets and needed to come up with a viable solution. I suggested we should start attending construction conferences  so we could carry out market research, learn more about our target audience and better market our products and services to potential clients. As a result, we were able to stay updated on trends, bring awareness to our business and build strong working relationships. To date the business still continues to attend construction events.

**Teamwork**\
Working well with others is one of the most important skills in any job. I believe that learning from other people is the fastest way to build your own understanding. I've demonstrated and developed these skills during my previous career in Sales and continue to apply them in group agile projects at Makers, such as Acebook, Makersbnb and Space Trash. After graduating Makers I continued to collaborate with other people to do projects and learn together.

**Communication**\
Studying at Makers reinforced the importance of open communication. Across numerous projects I worked with students who each had different strengths and abilities. I facilitated daily conversations with members of the team to ensure they felt valued, listened to, and could share their ideas for the project. I would also encourage honest feedback from my cohorts, as regular feedback is key not only for self and team development but for improving your product and service. It enabled us to see what aspects of our coding process we needed to concentrate on and improve. I also found assisting others helped to reinforce my own learning. I believe open communication is key to a healthy business. Through this we can raise self-awareness, empathy and social skills.

## Hobbies

* Yoga. The best way to relax and stretch after day of coding. Enjoy doing yoga inside or outside, just need my yoga mat and I can disconnect and refocus.
* Horse riding. I grew up surrounded by animals and for me time that you spend with a horse is similar to meditation. You live in the moment and concetrate only on the movement.
* Reading. I can read any time, anywhere. Just give me an exciting book and I will dissapear for hours.
