I am a junior full stack developer currently studying at Makers Academy. I find coding highly creative, inspirational and challenging and I love the fact you can bring any idea into life.

## Skills

**Great communicator**
While studying at university I was tutoring Russian for an American. He had some knowledge of language but wanted to speak more fluently. In just over a month of hard work we made huge progress and he could understand everything and speak more fluent in Russian.

**Quick learner**
When I was preparing for an interview for Makers Academy within a week I have completed Ruby course from scratch on Codecademy and went up to 6 kyu on Codewars. After that I felt confident in solving simple problems in Ruby.

**Team player**
I was working on a group project while studying at Beetroot Academy. We had less than a week left before presentation and one of teammates went really ill. I made sure his tasks were equally spread between the team in addition to our tasks. After working together we managed to complete our project in time and made great presentation.
