I am a dedicated, self-motivated full stack developer and recent graduate of Makers Academy. I have transitioned into technology after working in Sales. Software development has everything that I am passionate about: constantly learning new things; collaborating with like-minded people and using creativity and logic. I'm looking to join a team where I can continue to learn and become the best developer I can be.

## Skills

**Adaptability**\
After moving countries twice and changing schools three times, being adaptable became second nature to me. This trait was enhanced further during Makers Academy, when the course became remote. Whether adapting to new ways of working in an ever-changing world, or adjusting to user requirements, I am extremely capable.

**Teamwork**\
Working well with others is one of the most important skills in any job. I believe that learning from other people is the fastest way to build your own understanding. I've demonstrated and developed these skills during my previous career in Sales and continue to apply them in group agile projects at Makers, such as Acebook, Makersbnb and Space Trash. After graduating Makers I continued to collaborate with other people to do projects and learn together.

**Quick learner**\
Makers Academy bootcamp runs for just 12 weeks and in that short period of time I learnt 3 different programming languages and most valuably, the art of self-learning. For our final project we were given less than 2 weeks. In that time I built understanding of Python, machine learning, the Django framework and knowledge of orbits and space debris.

**Communication**\
While studying at university I also tutored Russian to an American student in my spare time. In just over a month of hard work we made huge progress and he could speak more fluent Russian and had a greater understanding of the language.

Speak English, Russian and Ukrainian

## Experience

**Belyi Irbis (January 2016 to January 2019)**\
Sales Administrator
* Made product presentations in front of panels of clients.
* Negotiated pricing, quantity and lead-time delivery terms and key product inputs from factories and suppliers.
* Assisted customers with product evaluation and used my knowledge of product lines to advise best alternatives.

## Hobbies

* Yoga. The best way to relax and stretch after day of coding. Enjoy doing yoga inside or outside, just need my yoga mat and I can disconnect and refocus.
* Horse riding. I grew up surrounded by animals and for me time that you spend with a horse is similar to meditation. You live in the moment and concetrate only on the movement.
* Reading. I can read any time, anywhere. Just give me an exciting book and I will dissapear for hours.
