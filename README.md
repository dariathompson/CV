# Daria Thompson

I am a dedicated, self-motivated full-stack developer and recent graduate of Makers Academy. I have transitioned into technology after working in Sales. Software development has everything that I am passionate about: constantly learning new things; collaborating with likeminded people and using creativity and logic. I'm looking to join a team where I can continue to learn and become the best developer I can be.

## Skills

**Great communicator**\
While studying at university I was tutoring Russian for an American. He had some knowledge of language but wanted to speak more fluently. In just over a month of hard work we made huge progress and he could understand everything and speak more fluent in Russian.

**Adaptability**\
After moving to another country and changing schools twice, being adaptable became second nature - and it was only pushed further after going remote after first month at Makers. Whether it be adapting to new way of working or adjusting to ever-changing user requirements, I am more than capable.

**Team player**\
Working well with others is one of the most important skills in any job. I believe that learning from other people is the fastest way to build your own understanding. I've demonstrated and developed these skills during my previous career in Sales and continue to apply them in group projects at Makers, such as Acebook, Makersbnb in agile teams. After graduating Makers I continued to collaborate with other people to do projects and learn together.

**Quick learner**\
The Makers Academy bootcamp is only 12 weeks long. In that time, I digested a huge amount of information everyday.
